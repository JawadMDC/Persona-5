Assignment: Final Project

About this Project: I made a text based console game which is influenced from the game _Persona 5 Royal_ (P5R). In my game you play as __Joker__ (the main character from P5R) and you're exploring __Kamoshida's Palace__. In P5R, Kamoshida is the first boss and you must explore his palace before you get to find him. The game I made doesn't include the boss Kamoshida himself, however, it includes all of the enemies, which are called shadows. I took all the names of the shadows from P5R and put them in my game. In my game you are presented with your health (starts off at 100) and you must go against the shadow (health is random but max is 90). You are given 7 options:

1. Physical attack- this attack can deal a max of 40 damage

2. Gun attack- this attack can deal a max of 25 damage

3. Help from __Ryuji__- Ryuji is Jokers friend from P5R and in my game you can use Ryuji to instant kill the shadow your up against. To not make things broken, you can only use Ryuji's ability once since start and as you fight shadows you have a 5% chance of making Ryuji use his skill again.

4. Health Potion-

5. Super Health Potion-

6. Advice from __Morgana__-

7. Flee from Shadow
