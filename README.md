Assignment: Final Project

About this Project: I made a text based console game which is influenced from the game _Persona 5 Royal_ (P5R). In my game you play as __Joker__ (the main character from P5R) and you're exploring __Kamoshida's Palace__. In P5R, Kamoshida is the first boss and you must explore his palace before you get to find him. The game I made doesn't include the boss Kamoshida himself, however, it includes all of the enemies, which are called shadows. I took all the names of the shadows from P5R and put them in my game. In my game you are presented with your health (starts off at 100) and you must go against the shadow (health is random but max is 90). You are given 7 options:

1. Physical attack- this attack can deal a max of 40 damage.

2. Gun attack- this attack can deal a max of 25 damage.

3. Help from __Ryuji__- Ryuji is Jokers friend from P5R and in my game you can use Ryuji to instant kill the shadow your up against. To not make things broken, you can only use Ryuji's ability once since start and as you fight shadows you have a 5% chance of making Ryuji use his skill again.

4. Health Potion- this option is used to heal Jokers health by 15. When you start out you will be given 5 health potions and after defeating a shadow you will have a 35% chance to steal one from the shadow.

5. Super Health Potion- this option is used to heal Jokers health by 40. When you start out you will be given 1 super health potions and after defeating a shadow you will have a 10% chance to steal one from the shadow.

6. Advice from __Morgana__- Morgana is a cat from P5R and he assists Joker with his real life and phantom thief life, such as being in the palace. In my game I added this option and by choosing this you would be given 4 options to select from. Each of these 4 options are just for basic info so that the player can understand whatever they're confused with.

7. Flee from Shadow- this is quite self explanatory but essentially if you want to skip a battle then this would be the option you would want to choose.

If a shadow defeats you (meaning that Jokers health is = 0) than it's game over and you would be given the message: "You'll get them next time pal, keep training in Mementos!". Mementos is a place in P5R where you can train to get stronger for palaces. 

If you defeat a shadow than you would have the option to continue the game or end it, it's up to you!

I hope those of you who play this game have a fun time. I know it may not be the best but it's my first actual Java project. For those who plan on forking this project, I'm excited to see what changes you guys can add. Thanks for reading up to here!
